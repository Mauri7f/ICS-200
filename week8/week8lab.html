            <p>
                This is just a normal 10 wheeler that is very
                common around all construction sites.

            <h2>10 Wheeler's Job</h2>
            <p>
                The main purpose of having a 10 wheeler is to move
                dirt around that was excavated, or take it
                somewhere to get rid of it. The dirt can also be used in 
                completely seperate job sites because some places 
                are just in need of it.
            </p>

            <h2>The Super 10</h2>
            <p>
                This is also considered a 10 wheeler but they refer to it as
                a super ten wheeler. These trucks have a drop down axel that 
                allow the truck to carry more weight than a normal 10 wheeler.
